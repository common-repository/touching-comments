Touching Comments or selected comments. Every comment, a story to behold! 

== Description ==

Everyone makes a comment at different times and in different stories.

Perhaps it's just these inadvertent words that give you a touch of warmth and emotion in the present moment.

Administrators have the option to mark user comments under the article as touching comments and display these selected touching comments on a independent page.

This makes it convenient for us to revisit the mood and warmth of that moment in the future.

== Installation ==

= Installation from within WordPress =

1. Visit **Plugins > Add New Plugin**.
2. Search for **Touching Comments**.
3. Install and activate the Plugin.

= Manual installation =

1. Download **Touching Comments**.
2. Upload the entire `touching-comments` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What should I do if the pagination of touching comments on the independent page isn't working when clicked? =

The pagination functionality relies on WordPress enabling the comment pagination function. If the plugin's pagination clicking isn't effective, check whether the checkbox in **Dashboard - Settings - Discussion - Other comment settings - Break comments into pages** is checked.
